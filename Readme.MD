Before run the code, please do the following steps:

1 - Make sure you have installed MySQL or SQLServer
2 - Create a SQL database and call it "Register_Plataform"
3 - Create a table and call it "Usuarios"
4 - There's a chance you might not receive a code via email, because outlook is blocking this kind of email somtimes,
however I show the code on the terminal
